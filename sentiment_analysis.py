# Function to convert a list of words into a dictionary format for classifier
# Example: ["good", "movie"] -> {"good": True, "movie": True}

# Example: ({"good": True, "movie": True}, "pos")

# Split dataset into training and testing
# First 1600 for training, remaining ~400 for testing

# ---------------- Train Classifier ---------------- #
# Train Naive Bayes classifier on training set

# Measure accuracy on test set
